# ðŸ“œ Timeline App â€” Stageâ€¯3 (Taskâ€¯3)

## Overview
Stageâ€¯3 builds upon Stageâ€¯2 by **loading events dynamically from JSON using JavaScript** and adding an interactive **modal popup** to view full event details.  
The layout remains responsive and perfectly aligned across devices, with compact preview cards and accessible interactions.

---

## Features Implemented

### Dynamic Content
- Fetches event data from `events.json` on page load.
- Generates event cards in the `#timeline` section dynamically using JavaScript.
- Ensures card structure matches CSS layout for perfect alignment.

### Responsive Layout
- **CSS Grid** for event cards:  
  - Two-column layout on desktop.  
  - Single-column stacking on tablet/mobile.  
- **Flexbox** for vertical card content alignment and for centering modal content.

### Event Card Styling
- White or gradient background cards with drop shadows and rounded corners.
- Fixedâ€‘height images with `object-fit: cover` for consistent appearance.
- 3â€‘line truncated event descriptions for uniform card heights.
- Styled category, year, and title for clear emphasis.
- Hover scaling effect for interactivity.

### Modal Popup
- Dark semiâ€‘transparent overlay using `position: fixed`, covers full viewport.
- Card click (or keyboard Enter/Space) opens modal with:
  - Larger event image
  - Title and year
  - Full event description
  - Category
  - **Close button** at the top right.
- Close modal by clicking the button or clicking outside the modal.

### Accessibility
- All cards have `tabindex="0"` for keyboard navigation.
- Enter/Space key opens modal when a card is focused.
- Close button labeled for assistive technologies.

### Breakpoints
- **Mobile (<900px):** Single column, reduced gaps/padding.
- **Tablet (900â€“1023px):** Single column, larger padding.
- **Desktop (â‰¥1024px):** Two-column grid, centered container.

## Files for Stageâ€¯3
- `index.html` â€“ HTML structure with empty `#timeline` container and modal markup.
- `styles.css` â€“ Layout, styling, and responsive rules for cards and modal.

## How to View

1. **Run a local server** (required for `fetch()` to load `events.json`):
   - **VS Code Live Server Extension:** Rightâ€‘click `index.html` â†’ *Open with Live Server*  
   - **OR** Python 3:
     ```
     python -m http.server
     ```
     Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

2. **Test Responsiveness**  
   Resize the browser window to see mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts.

3. **Interact with Modals**
   - Click (or press Enter/Space on) any event card to open the modal.
